# Doughnuts For Dessert Remake

This is a remake of the project I made during my time at NAIT. Although it looks appealing according to the comments made by my peers, it lacks responsive design which makes it hard for users on mobile to navigate.

## This site is still WIP!

I am trying to remake this site using NextJS 13 and I am learning new things along the way!
